### Hi there, I am Tadeu! ðŸ‘‹

Let me introduce myself. 

I am a very happy person who likes to engage in new adventures, discovering new technologies and looking to learn more and more every day. Tell me to do a task and I will do my best to give you the best solution. 

I am studding BSc Computing and It, and I am working on different projects at the same time. 

I started coding few years ago, and now I love coding. I am looking forward to become a Software Engineer and bring solutions to every enterprise. 

I like out-side activities such as fishing, cycling, stand-up and such. I also like playing games on consoles, and on the PC. I enjoy going out and meet people, but I rather be with my wife and some close friends on a night out on the beach with a bonfire and some good wine.
